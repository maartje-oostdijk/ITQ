# ITQ
scripts and data for the I, the T, the Q (the question these models try and answer is what attribute of fisheries management systems, in particular quota systems
preserve the health of marine stocks)

They reflect analysis presented in a manuscript in preparation by Oostdijk & Carpenter (2021)

the data folder contains classification data and information on a few fish stocks, https://www.ramlegacy.org/ hosts the RAM legacy stock assessment database v4.491

the script management_models_final.R contains the first models in the manuscript, relating management regimes to overfishing and overfished biomass

the script classifications_final.R contains contains the script that classifies management regimes by their attributes

the script classifications_models_final.R contains the models that relate fisheries management attributes to overfishing/overfished

the script DiD_by_attribute_final.R contains the models that relate fisheries management attributes to overfishing/overfished using a DiD approach

the script DID_Q_ITQ.R contains the models that compare fleet quota fisheries changing to IQ/ITQ to fisheries remain under fleet quota management
